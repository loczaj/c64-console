                  -----------------------------------------



o Hardware requirements

  * IBM PC, or compatible computer
  * 1MB of free disk space
  * Bi-directional paralell port, or
    ECP paralell port with "bi-dir" (or "byte" / "PS2") mode supported
  * Cable described in file "cable.txt"
  * Commodore 64 computer with some storage


o Software requirements

  * Linux 2.4.x with loadable module support
  * Linux includes in /usr/src/linux/include
  * Gcc
  * GNU make
  * Ncurses (5) include: /usr/include/ncurses.h
  * Ncurses (5) libs


o Another requirements

  * Root permission for installation


o Setting the BIOS

  * Enter the BIOS setting mode on your PC
  * Switch on the paralell port and set its mode to one of the followings:
    
    . bi-directional mode
    . SPP mode with bi-directional support
    . ECP mode (with "bi-dir" (or "byte" / "PS2") mode supported)
  
    If your paralell port supports none of these modes, you can not
    and should not use this software. Altough the ECP mode supports
    bi-directional feature more often than not.

  * Choose a free irq and a free base address for the paralell port
    and note these settings.


o Building the cable

  * See file "cable.txt" for how to build the cable.


o Linux part - the kernel module (kmod configuration)

  * You need to have root permissions to install the kernel module.
  
  * Type 'make' in the linux-driver/ directory
  * Copy c64_console.o from this dir to /lib/modules/2.4.x/kernel/drivers/char/,
    where "2.4.x" is your kernelversion
  * Add the following two lines to the file /etc/modules.conf:
    
    alias char-major-248   c64_console
    options c64_console    irq=II io=0xBBB
    
    where "II" is the irq of the paralell port, and
    "BBB" is the base address of the paralell port (see BIOS)
    Default values: irq=07, io=0x278
  * Create the ccons device by typing:
    'mknod /dev/ccons c 248 0'
  * Set permissions for reading and writing the device:
    'chmod a+rw /dev/ccons'
  * Handle dependency descriptions for loadable kernel modules
    by typing 'depmod -a'


o Linux part - the console application

  * You need to have root permissions to install the console application.

  * Type 'make' in the linux-console/ directory
  * Copy the file 'console' to /usr/local/bin
  * Set permissions for executing the application:
    'chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/console'
  

o C64 part

  * Either:
    . Type the CBM BASIC program "loader.bas" of the c64/ directory
    . Save it so that it can easily be retreived:
       To disk: SAVE"LOADER",8
       To tape: SAVE"LOADER",1
    
    . Hint: After you ran the basic loader prg, you can save the
            binary with a monitor program: .S"ADAPTER",08,C000,C07C
  
  * Or:
    . Copy the CBM binary program "adapter.prg" of the c64/ directory
      to a 1541 floppy disk with Star Commander using an X1541 cable.


o Running

  * Power off the Commodore 64
  * Connect the cable built to the paralell port and the Commodore user port.
    Beware of connecting, it is easy to plug the connector upside down.
  * Power on the Commodore 64
  
  * Either load the adapter program
    . From disk: LOAD"ADAPTER",8,1
    . From tape: LOAD"ADAPTER",1,1
  
  * Or load the BASIC loader program
    . From disk: LOAD"LOADER",8
    . From tape: LOAD"LOADER",1
    And run it : RUN

  * Start the adapter: SYS 49152
  * Now you have no cursor while the kernel module 
    "c64_console" is not loaded on the PC
  * Hint: you can shut down the adapter by pressing runstop + restore keys

  * Run the console application on the linux in a console / terminal with
    minimal size 40x25: 'console'.
  * Hint: You can use SVGATextMode to have 40x25 text consoles in the linux.
          For that you need to be root and do the followings.
          Add this new modeline to the file /etc/TextConfig:
  
          "40x25"  14.32  320 340 388 400  400 412 414 449  font 9x16

          Start SVGATextMode: 'SVGATextMode 40x25'
